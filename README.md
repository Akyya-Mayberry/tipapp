# Pre-work - *TipApp*

**TipApp** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Akyya Mayberry**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
1.) When user changes default, it will be nice to receive a simple confirmation note or green check mark
2.) Providing a better tipping range
3.) Give graphical tip recommendations based on a provided quality of service user received (bad, ok, great, superb!)
4.) Better UI (clear text-box fields and buttons, color etc.)

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1.) There was some differences in syntax for Swift between when the pre-work and video tutorial was made and now.
2.) Apples Swift documentation is different from other language documentation (no example code snippets), so finding information quickly and knowing if you implemented a function or something properly takes a bit more effort.
